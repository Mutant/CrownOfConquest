Installation
------------

This has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, but should work on most flavours of Linux.

* checkout source code into some dir (e.g. 'crown')
* install some packages:
  * libgd
  * cpanminus
  * gcc
  * mysql-server
  * libdbd-mysql-perl
* From the crown directory, run:
  cpanm --instaldeps .
* Create the DB:
  mysqladmin create database crown
  mysql crown < crown/db/schema.sql
* Create a config file for your instance by copying rpg_template.yml to rpg_$instance.yml (e.g. rpg_main.yml)
  Check configuration settings look correct (particularly DB settings)
* Make sure STRICT_TRANS_TABLES and ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mysql sql modes are turned off
* Create a cron job with the 'new_day' script
