### Overview

Crown of Conquest is web-based RPG. See http://crownofconquest.com/ for the 'official' installation.

This README documents how to set up your own Crown server. Note, it's not trivial. You will probably do better if you have some experience deploying web applications.

This is also a hobby project, so the docs are not comprehensive. I'm happy to answer questions if I can though (see Contact below).

### Installation
This has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, but should work on most flavours of Linux.

* checkout source code into some dir (e.g. '$HOME/crown')
* install some packages:
  * libgd
  * cpanminus
  * gcc
  * mysql-server
  * libdbd-mysql-perl
* From the crown directory, run:
```
  sudo cpanm --instaldeps .
```
* Create the DB:
```
  mysqladmin create database crown
  mysql crown < crown/db/schema.sql
```
* Generate a new world (this takes a while)
```
crown/db/create_world.pl
```
 See crown/db/world_gen/README for more details
* Create a config file for your instance by copying rpg_template.yml to rpg_local.yml
  Check configuration settings look correct (particularly DB settings). This file shouldn't get checked in, as it likely contains private data (e.g. DB password).
* Make sure STRICT_TRANS_TABLES and ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mysql sql modes are turned off in the mysqlconfig
  On Ubuntu, this is best done by adding a file /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/custom.cnf
  with the following contents:
```
[mysqld]
sql_mode = "NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION"
```
* Create log and var directories (by default, crown/log & crown/var) and make sure they're writeable by appropriate user
* Create a cron job for the 'new_day' script, it needs to run every 5 minutes, e.g.
```
*/5 * * * * RPG_HOME=$HOME/crown/ $HOME/crown/script/new_day.pl
```
* Set some environment variables:
```
RPG_HOME=$HOME/crown
RPG_DEV=1
```
* Start up the server (this is just a 'dev' server for now - you will need to use Plack to start up the real server, see below).
```
perl crown/rpg_server.pl
```
* You should then be able to navigate to (e.g.) http://localhost:3000 and register an account
  Make sure you set url_root in rpg_local.ymp to the appropriate base url
* To get access to the admin panel, set the 'admin' flag on the Player record in the DB to true
  You'll then be able to nagivate to http://localhost:3000/admin

### Using Plack/Starman

Full details are beyond the scope of this README, but there is an init script called script/plack.

Running this will start up the application in Starman. By default, it runs on port 8080. You will need
a webserver to act as the frontend (e.g. apache or nginx) and proxy to Starman.

Note, if RPG_DEV is set to true, the application server will serve all static content. For the Plack
setup, you probably don't want this (you want the webserver to serve content) so make sure RPG_DEV is
not set to true.
