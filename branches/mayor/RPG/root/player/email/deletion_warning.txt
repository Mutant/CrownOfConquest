<p>Hi,</p>

<p>You signed up to Kingdoms ([% url %]), but you haven't logged in in over [% warning_days %] days. If you don't log in within the next 
[% grace_days %] days, your account will be disabled.</p>

<p>You'll be able to re-enable your account by logging back in, although you may lose some standing in the game in the mean time.</p>

<p>Also, there is a maximum number of active players allowed, so if that number has been reached, you won't be able to re-activate your account until 
some other players go inactive (or the maximum number of players is increased).</p>

<p>If you have any questions, or are having technical difficulties, please don't hesitate to reply to this email, or post in our forum: [% forum_url %]</p>
