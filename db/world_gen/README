These scripts are used to generate a new world. For convenience, they are separate scripts, but they should probably be run via crown/create_world.pl

It will connect to the DB as specified in your config (e.g. rpg.yml/rpg_local.yml). create_world.pl will do some checks to make sure the DB looks 'new'
(i.e. doesn't already have a world). However, the sub-scripts do  *not* do these checks, so be careful.

Also in this directory is the config file to control the size of the world to be generated, and some other parameters. These settings can be overridden
in your local config file (e.g. rpg_local.yml).
