<b>Note</b>: The help is really only a basic guide at the moment. The focus right now is getting the features completed, so there are
a lot of holes in the Help. But if you have any questions or problems, please post them in the <a href="[% forum_url %]">forum</a>.

<h2>Party</h2>

See <a href="[% base %]/help/create_party">Party Creation</a>.

<h2>Equipment</h2>

<p>Equipment fits into several different categories, such as Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, Shields and Armour. Items can be purchased from the shops in
a town, or found on defeated creatures.</p>

<p>Once bought, items must be equipped to use. To do this, click on the character's name on the main screen to go to the character's page. Click on the
equipment tab, and drag the item into the appropriate slot.</p>

<p>Some items are more frequently found than others. Larger towns (i.e. those with higher prosperity) tend to have more shops, and a bigger range of items.</p>

<h2>Towns</h2>

<p>Towns are essential to survival. Each town has the same basic options screen (see screenshot below).

<p>Starting from the top; the town name is shown as well as its prosperity rating. Prosperity varies from town to town and is an indicator of how large the town is 
and how bountiful its quests and equipment might be. A number of factors affect prosperity such as killing monster mobs within a certain area of the city, 
destroying orbs, completing quests, how well the mayor runs the city, etc.</p>

<img src="[% c.config.static_path %]/images/help/town_menu.png" border="1" align="left">

<p>Next we have "your" prestige rating for the town. You start out with a neutral rating in each town, this can be increased simply by completing quests for the 
town. The more you do for a town the more prestige you will gain naturally.</p>

<p>Next is the mayor of the town. Each town starts out with a NPC mayor whom can be overthrown by players by either winning an election and simply taking the 
mayor out of office or by raiding the town. If a raid is successful you may appoint one of your party members as mayor. Being mayor of a town has many 
benefits such as collecting tax money from the towns people and gaining discounted prices of equipment.</p>

<p>Shops and services allow player parties to accomplish many things.</p> 

<p>Equipment shops takes you to the list of shops within each town. Some towns may have multiple shops open and some may have only one. 
Again prosperity is a relatively good way to judge this.</p>

<p>Healer is self explanatory! If you need to resurrect a party member or simply heal up your entire party go here.</p>
 
<p>Sage is all knowing, if you are trying to find a specific town, dungeon, or item go here and the sage will tell you for a price of course.</p>
 
<p>The blacksmith is a very useful tool within Kingdoms. Each town has a different blacksmith, and some have no blacksmith at all. Before using a blacksmith 
be sure to read up on him each blacksmith can range in skill level from "terrible" to "god-like". Blacksmiths can repair all items damaged from combat and
more importantly upgrade your party's items. Depending on the blacksmiths skill you could have the blacksmith fail to upgrade your item, or he could upgrade it
without any penalties at all. Please take note that there is a difference between magic items and upgraded items.</p>

<p>The recruitment office allows players to purchase new party members as well as sell the ones already owned. The available characters range in price determined 
of course by level, xp and skill points. This feature will play a very important role in the game once you start using Garrisons. Each group starts with five 
characters but a player is allowed up to 8 in his party total at one time.</p>

<p>The Town Hall gives you three options. "Quests" is simply where you go to take on quests for a town and also generally speaking where you go to complete a quest.</p>

<p>News tells you detailed news for the town from day to day. Finally the cemetery if you feel like burying your dead for all to see.</p> 

<h3>Tax</h3>

<p>Each town charges a tax to enter for the day. You can pay this by "working" (using up turns), or in gold. Each game day you'll have to pay tax again
to enter the town.</p>

<p>The amount of tax you pay is determined by a number of factors, including the size of the town, and your prestige with the town.</p>

<h2>The Wilderness</h2>

<p>Once you leave town, you're in the wilderness. Here, you'll find groups of monsters roaming free. Some may attack you, or you may choose to initiate combat
yourself.</p>

<p>To move around, click on a sector on the map next to the current location of your party (indicated by the blue square). You can zoom the map with the zoom
buttons to the left. Any blank squares are ones you have yet to explore.</p>

<p>As you move through the wilderness, your party will record the terrain around them. Clicking on the "Map" link on the left hand menu will display all the
terrain your party has currently seen. Clicking on a sector on this screen will centre the map on it, allowing you to view the entire map.</p>

<p>The amount of turns it takes to move to a particular sector depends on your party's Movement Factor (displayed above the map, based on the constitution of
your characters), and the type of terrain. Mousing over a sector on the map will tell you how many turns it will cost to move there. (For towns, 
it will also display the name of the town, and its prosperity).</p>

<h3>Orbs</h3>

<p>You'll find Orbs scattered throughout the wilderness. These evil devices are responsible for spawning monsters. If you're high enough level, you may be able
to destroy the orb (be careful though - they'll be protected!) Destroying orbs can help towns increase their prosperity.</p> 

<h2>Combat</h2>

<p>When moving through the wilderness, you will encounter groups of creatures. They may attack you, or you can choose to initiate combat yourself. Be careful
though, as some are much tougher than others!</p>

<p>Combat is divided into rounds. Each round, you can select which action a character will take. They can either attack (choosing an opponent at random), 
defend (gaining a defensive bonus), target a particular opponent, or cast a spell. To execute the round, choose either "Fight" or "Flee" (if you've
had enough of this battle, and want to get out alive).</p>

<p>In most cases, characters will only attack once per round. However, under certain circumstances, characters will attack more frequently. For example,
when using ranged weapons, archers will attack twice every second round.</p>

<p>Each round of combat also uses one of your party's turns. However, you can keep fighting even if your turns go below zero.</p>

<p>At the end of combat, if you've defeated the creatures, you will receive experience, gold and maybe even find an item.</p>

<h3>Party Rank</h3>

<p>During combat, your party will divide itself into two ranks - front and back. In the party list on the main screen, a black line indicates the
separation between front and back ranks. This line can't be changed during combat. Outside of combat, you can drag the line, or characters themselves,
to change how the ranks will form.</p>

<p>Characters in the front rank have a greater chance of being targetted by opponents. However those in the back rank will receive penalties when trying
to attack with a melee weapon.</p>

<h3>The Watcher</h3>

<p>When your party starts out, they'll automatically get a "Watcher" effect. This is a force that stays with the party, and gives them an indication of how
tough a group of creatures in the current sector is. This effect lasts for a few game days. After that, you'll need one of your mages to cast another
"Watcher" spell.</p>

<h3>Offline Combat</h3>

<p>If you log out of the game in the middle of a battle, or if you leave your party in the wilderness, your party can be attacked while you're offline. You'll
receive notification of any battles you were in when you next log in.</p>

<h2>Spells</h2>

<p>Two character classes - Mages and Priests - have the ability to cast spells. A particular spell can be cast either in or outside of combat (or sometimes
both). If a character has an appropriate spell memorised, it will be available to you in the "Action" menu next to the character's name.</p>

<p>To choose which spells a character has memorised, click on the character's name in the main screen to go to the character's page, and click the "Spells"
tab. There you can see which spells the character has memorised today, and which s/he'll memorise tomorrow. You can change which spells s/he will memorise
tomorrow, and these will be updated the next day. A new character has a default set of spells memorised, and these probably need to be changed.</p>

<h2>Quests</h2>

<p>Each town has a town hall where your party can elect to take on a Quest. Various different types of quests are available, and these will be explained
before you accept the quest. Clicking on the "Quests" link on the left hand menu will display the quests your party has accepted, and give instructions
on what needs to be done to complete the quest.</p>

<p>The number of quests a party can accept is limited by your party's level. Additionally, only one quest per town can be accepted.</p>

<p>Each quest has a time limit to complete. If you don't complete the quest in time, you'll lose prestige with the town.</p>

<h2>New Day</h2>

<p>Every 24 hours, a new day will be started within the game. This will give your party another [% c.config.daily_turns %] turns, up to a maximum of
[% c.config.maximum_turns %]. Your spell-casters' spells will also be re-memorised, and if your party is rested, they will heal.</p>

<h2>Dungeons</h2>

<p>If you've tired of the wilderness, you can find dungeons to explore. These underground labyrinths have large concentrations of high level creatures. You can find
them by accident (by entering a sector with a dungeon entrance), or through a sage.</p>

<h2>Garrisons</h2>

<p>At party level [% c.config.minimum_garrison_level %], you can create garrisons. A garrison lets you assign one or more characters to stay in the sector, and
battle monsters while the party is away. You can give the garrison certain orders (letting it know what to do when a group of monsters or another party enter
the sector), and you can also store equipment and gold there.</p>

<h2>Kingdoms</h2>

<p>The world is divided up into several Kingdoms. Each town is loyal to a Kingdom (unless they are a free town), and each sector can be owned by a Kingdom. Parties
can also declare their loyalty to a Kingdom, or become free citizens. You can change your loyalty by going to Party > Kingdom.</p>

<p>Some Kingdoms are controlled by NPCs, some by players. Either way, the king or queen can give you quests. Like town quests, these offer rewards of gold and
experience, and in addition will help further the cause of your Kingdom.</p>

<p>If you control [% c.config.town_count_for_kingdom_declaration %] or more towns, and have a party level of [% c.config.minimum_kingdom_level %] or higher, you
can declare your own Kingdom. This will let you set quests for the parties in your Kingdom, and collect tax from any towns loyal to you.</p>
