<h2>Party</h2>

See <a href="[% base %]/help/create_party">Party Creation</a>.

<h2>Equipment</h2>

<p>Equipment fits into several different categories, such as Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, Shields and Armour. Items can be purchased from the shops in
a town, or found on defeated creatures.</p>

<p>Once bought, items must be equipped to use. To do this, click on the character's name on the main screen to go to the character's page. Click on the
equipment tab, and drag the item into the appropriate slot.</p>

<p>Some items are more frequently found than others. Larger towns (i.e. those with higher prosperity) tend to have more shops, and a bigger range of items.</p>

<h2>Towns</h2>

<p>Towns are essential to survival. They allow your party to heal, buy equipment, and find quests, amongst other things.</p>

<p>Each town has a "prosperity" rating. This indicates how big the town is, and how useful (and cheap) it's services are likely to be.</p>

<h2>The Wilderness</h2>

<p>Once you leave town, you're in the wilderness. Here, you'll find groups of monsters roaming free. Some may attack you, or you may choose to initiate combat
yourself.</p>

<p>To move around, click on a sector on the map next to the current location of your party (indicated by the blue square).</p>

<p>As you move through the wilderness, your party will record the terrain around them. Clicking on the "Map" link on the left hand menu will display all the
terrain your party has currently seen. Clicking on a sector on this screen will centre the map on it, alowing you can view the entire map.</p>

<p>The amount of turns it takes to move to a particular sector depends on your party's Movement Factor (displayed above the map, based on the constitution of
your characters), and the type of terrain. Mousing over a sector on the map will tell you how many turns it will cost to move there. (For towns, 
it will also display the name of the town, and its prosperity).</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>

<p>When moving through the wilderness, you will encounter groups of creatures. They may attack you, or you can choose to initiate combat yourself. Be careful
though, as some are much tougher than others!</p>

<p>Combat is divided into rounds. Each round, you can select which action a character will take. They can either attack (choosing an opponent at random), 
defend (gaining a defensive bonus), target a particular opponent, or cast a spell. To execute the round, choose either "Fight" or "Flee" (if you've
had enough of this battle, and want to get out alive).</p>

<p>In most cases, characters will only attack once per round. However, under certain circumstances, characters will attack more frequently. For example,
when using ranged weapons, archers will attack twice every second round.</p>

<p>Each round of combat also uses one of your party's turns. However, you can keep fighting even if your turns go below zero.</p>

<p>At the end of combat, if you defeated the creatures, you will receive experience, gold and maybe even find an item.</p>

<h3>Party Rank</h3>

<p>During combat, your party will divide itself into two ranks - front and back. In the party list on the main screen, a black line indicates the
separation between front and back ranks. This line can't be changed during combat. Outside of combat, you can drag the line, or characters themselves,
to change how the ranks will form.</p>

<p>Characters in the front rank have a greater chance of being targetted by opponents. However those in the back rank will receive penalties when trying
to attack with a melee weapon.</p>

<h2>Spells</h2>

<p>Two character classes - Mages and Priests - have the capability to cast spells. A particular spell can be cast either in or outside of combat (or sometimes
both). If a character has an appropriate spell memorised, it will be available to you in the "Action" menu next to the character's name.</p>

<p>To choose which spells a character has memorised, click on the character's name in the main screen to go to the character's page, and click the "Spells"
tab. There you can see which spells the character has memorised today, and which he'll memorise tomorrow. You can change which spells s/he will memorise
tomorrow, and these will be updated the next day. A new character has a default set of spells memorised, and these probably need to be changed.</p>

<h2>Quests</h2>

<p>Each town has a town hall where your party can elect to take on a Quest. Various different types of quests are available, and these will be explained
before you accept the quest. Clicking on the "Quests" link on the left hand menu will display the quests your party has accepted, and give instructions
on what needs to be done to complete the quest.</p>

<p>The number of quests a party can accept is limited by your party's level. Additionally, only one quest per town can be accepted.</p>

<h2>New Day</h2>

<p>Every 24 hours, a new day will be started within the game. This will give your party another [% c.config.daily_turns %] turns, up to a maximum of
[% c.config.maximum_turns %]. Your spell-casters' spells will also be re-memorised, and if your party is rested, they will heal.</p>
