<h3>Combat</h3>

<p>When moving through the wilderness, you will encounter groups of creatures. They may attack you, or you can choose to initiate combat yourself. Be careful
though, as some are much tougher than others!</p>

<p>Combat is divided into rounds. Each round, you can select which action a character will take. They can either attack (choosing an opponent at random),
defend (gaining a defensive bonus), target a particular opponent, or cast a spell. To execute the round, choose either "Fight" or "Flee" (if you've
had enough of this battle, and want to get out alive).</p>

<p>In most cases, characters will only attack once per round. However, under certain circumstances, characters will attack more frequently. For example,
when using ranged weapons, archers will attack twice every second round.</p>

<p>Each round of combat also uses one of your party's turns. However, you can keep fighting even if your turns go below zero.</p>

<p>At the end of combat, if you've defeated the creatures, you will receive experience, gold and maybe even find an item.</p>

<h3>Party Rank</h3>

<p>During combat, your party will divide itself into two ranks - front and back. In the party list on the main screen, a black line indicates the
separation between front and back ranks. This line can't be changed during combat. Outside of combat, you can drag the line, or characters themselves,
to change how the ranks will form.</p>

<p>Characters in the front rank have a greater chance of being targetted by opponents. However those in the back rank will receive penalties when trying
to attack with a melee weapon.</p>

<h3>The Watcher</h3>

<p>When your party starts out, they'll automatically get a "Watcher" effect. This is a force that stays with the party, and gives them an indication of how
tough a group of creatures in the current sector is. This effect lasts for a few game days. After that, you'll need one of your mages to cast another
"Watcher" spell.</p>

<h3>Offline Combat</h3>

<p>If you log out of the game in the middle of a battle, or if you leave your party in the wilderness, your party can be attacked while you're offline. You'll
receive notification of any battles you were in when you next log in.</p>
