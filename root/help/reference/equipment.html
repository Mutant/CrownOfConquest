<h3>Equipment</h3>

<p>Equipment fits into several different categories, such as Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, Shields and Armour. Items can be purchased from the shops in
a town, or found on defeated creatures.</p>

<p>Once bought, items must be equipped to use. To do this, click on the character's name on the main screen to go to the character's page. Click on the
equipment tab, and drag the item into the appropriate slot.</p>

<p>Some items are more frequently found than others. Larger towns (i.e. those with higher prosperity) tend to have more shops, and a bigger range of items.</p>
