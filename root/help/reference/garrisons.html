<h3>Garrisons</h3>

<p>At party level [% c.config.minimum_garrison_level %], you can create garrisons. A garrison lets you assign one or more characters to stay in the sector, and
battle monsters while the party is away. You can give the garrison certain orders (letting it know what to do when a group of monsters or another party enter
the sector), and you can also store equipment and gold there.</p>
