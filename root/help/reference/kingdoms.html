<h3>Kingdoms</h3>

<p>The world is divided up into several Kingdoms. Each town is loyal to a Kingdom (unless they are a free town), and each sector can be owned by a Kingdom. Parties
can also declare their loyalty to a Kingdom, or become free citizens. You can change your loyalty by going to Party > Kingdom.</p>

<p>Some Kingdoms are controlled by NPCs, some by players. Either way, the king or queen can give you quests. Like town quests, these offer rewards of gold and
experience, and in addition will help further the cause of your Kingdom.</p>

<p>If you control [% c.config.town_count_for_kingdom_declaration %] or more towns, and have a party level of [% c.config.minimum_kingdom_level %] or higher, you
can declare your own Kingdom. This will let you set quests for the parties in your Kingdom, and collect tax from any towns loyal to you.</p>
