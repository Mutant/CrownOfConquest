<h3>New Day</h3>

<p>Every 24 hours, a new day will be started within the game. This will give your party another [% c.config.daily_turns %] turns, up to a maximum of
[% c.config.maximum_turns %]. Your spell-casters' spells will also be re-memorised, and if your party is rested, they will heal.</p>
