<h3>New Day</h3>

<p>Every 24 hours, a new day will be started within the game. In your party, your spell-casters' spells will also be re-memorised, and if your party is rested,
they will heal. Many magical items give benefits each day (such as more turns or healing).</p>

<p>Each day, there are also many other changes around the Kingdom's world. Town prosperity may go up or down, mayor approval ratings can change, elections in towns
are run, etc.</p>
