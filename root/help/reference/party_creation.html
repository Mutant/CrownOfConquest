<h3>Party Creation</h3>

<p>Before you start playing, you'll need to create your party. First, choose a name for your party, and click "Add Character". This will take you to the new 
character screen.</p>

<p>Enter a name for the character, and choose the character's race and class (see below for descriptions of these). You can then adjust your
character's stats by typing numbers into the 'Modified' field. As you add stat points, you'll notice the "Points Remaining" is reduced. A new
character can have a maximum of [% c.config.stat_max %] for a particular stat.</p>
