<h3>Quests</h3>

<p>Each town has a town hall where your party can elect to take on a Quest. Various different types of quests are available, and these will be explained
before you accept the quest. Clicking on the "Quests" link on the left hand menu will display the quests your party has accepted, and give instructions
on what needs to be done to complete the quest.</p>

<p>The number of quests a party can accept is limited by your party's level. Additionally, only one quest per town can be accepted.</p>

<p>Each quest has a time limit to complete. If you don't complete the quest in time, you'll lose prestige with the town.</p>
