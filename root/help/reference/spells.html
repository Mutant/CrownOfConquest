<h3>Spells</h3>

<p>Two character classes - Mages and Priests - have the ability to cast spells. A particular spell can be cast either in or outside of combat (or sometimes
both). If a character has an appropriate spell memorised, it will be available to you in the "Action" menu next to the character's name.</p>

<p>To choose which spells a character has memorised, click on the character's name in the main screen to go to the character's page, and click the "Spells"
tab. There you can see which spells the character has memorised today, and which s/he'll memorise tomorrow. You can change which spells s/he will memorise
tomorrow, and these will be updated the next day. A new character has a default set of spells memorised, and these probably need to be changed.</p>
