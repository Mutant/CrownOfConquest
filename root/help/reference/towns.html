<h3>Towns</h3>

<p>Towns are essential to survival. Each town has the same basic options screen (see screenshot below).</p>

<p>Starting from the top; the town name is shown as well as its prosperity rating. Prosperity varies from town to town and is an indicator of how large the town is
and how bountiful its quests and equipment might be. A number of factors affect prosperity such as killing monster mobs within a certain area of the city,
destroying orbs, completing quests, how well the mayor runs the city, etc.</p>

<p>Next we have "your" prestige rating for the town. You start out with a neutral rating in each town, this can be increased simply by completing quests for the
town. The more you do for a town the more prestige you will gain naturally.</p>

<p>Next is the mayor of the town. Each town starts out with a NPC mayor whom can be overthrown by players by either winning an election and simply taking the
mayor out of office or by raiding the town. If a raid is successful you may appoint one of your party members as mayor. Being mayor of a town has many
benefits such as collecting tax money from the towns people and gaining discounted prices of equipment.</p>

<p>Shops and services allow player parties to accomplish many things.</p>

<p>Equipment shops takes you to the list of shops within each town. Some towns may have multiple shops open and some may have only one.
Again prosperity is a relatively good way to judge this.</p>

<p>Healer is self explanatory! If you need to resurrect a party member or simply heal up your entire party go here.</p>

<p>Sage is all knowing, if you are trying to find a specific town, dungeon, or item go here and the sage will tell you for a price of course.</p>

<p>The blacksmith is a very useful tool within Kingdoms. Each town has a different blacksmith, and some have no blacksmith at all. Before using a blacksmith
be sure to read up on him each blacksmith can range in skill level from "terrible" to "god-like". Blacksmiths can repair all items damaged from combat and
more importantly upgrade your party's items. Depending on the blacksmiths skill you could have the blacksmith fail to upgrade your item, or he could upgrade it
without any penalties at all. Please take note that there is a difference between magic items and upgraded items.</p>

<p>The recruitment office allows players to purchase new party members as well as sell the ones already owned. The available characters range in price determined
of course by level, xp and skill points. This feature will play a very important role in the game once you start using Garrisons. Each group starts with five
characters but a player is allowed up to 8 in his party total at one time.</p>

<p>The Town Hall gives you three options. "Quests" is simply where you go to take on quests for a town and also generally speaking where you go to complete a quest.</p>

<p>News tells you detailed news for the town from day to day. Finally the cemetery if you feel like burying your dead for all to see.</p>

<h3>Tax</h3>

<p>Each town charges a tax to enter for the day. You can pay this by "working" (using up turns), or in gold. Each game day you'll have to pay tax again
to enter the town.</p>

<p>The amount of tax you pay is determined by a number of factors, including the size of the town, and your prestige with the town.</p>
