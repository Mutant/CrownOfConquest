<h3>The Wilderness</h3>

<p>Once you leave town, you're in the wilderness. Here, you'll find groups of monsters roaming free. Some may attack you, or you may choose to initiate combat
yourself.</p>

<p>To move around, click on a sector on the map next to the current location of your party (indicated by the blue square). Any blank squares are ones you have yet 
to explore.</p>

<p>As you move through the wilderness, your party will record the terrain around them. Clicking on the "Map" link on the left hand menu will display all the
terrain your party has currently seen. Clicking on a sector on this screen will centre the map on it, allowing you to view the entire map.</p>

<p>The amount of turns it takes to move to a particular sector depends on your party's Movement Factor (displayed above the map, based on the constitution of
your characters), and the type of terrain. Mousing over a sector on the map will tell you how many turns it will cost to move there. (For towns, 
it will also display the name of the town, and its prosperity).</p>

<h4>Orbs</h4>

<p>You'll find Orbs scattered throughout the wilderness. These evil devices are responsible for spawning monsters. If you're high enough level, you may be able
to destroy the orb (be careful though - they'll be protected!) Destroying orbs can help towns increase their prosperity.</p>
