<h3>Main Screen</h3>

<p>The first time you log in to Crown Of Conquest, you will be taken to the main screen. Along the top of the screen, are various menu options, below that is
your party's status bar. To the right, are your party members, with their portraits and hit point bars. The main part of the screen shows a map of the world
- at least the part your party knows about. To begin with, this is just a small area around the town you start in.</p>

<p>As your party starts in a town, you will also see the town screen overlaying the map. This has various options which we'll go over in some detail later.</p>
