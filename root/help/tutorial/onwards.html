<h3>Onwards!</h3>

<p>That's the end of this guide, but it's by no means the end of your journey in the Crown Of Conquest world. In fact, we've barely scratched the surface. A few of the
things you might want to do as your party levels up:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Find a <a href="[% base %]help/reference/dungeons">dungeon</a>, where you'll find many more monsters to battle, not to mention treasure (and much more!)</li>
    <li>Create a <a href="[% base %]help/reference/garrisons">garrison</a> with some of your characters to earn gold and experience</li>
    <li>Become mayor of a town, through democratic means, or by force</li>
    <li>Construct towers, forts or castles</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information in the <a href="[% base %]help/reference/contents">reference guide</a>, or better yet - discover the game by playing it!</p>

<p>Good luck, and if you find yourself really stuck, head to the <a href="[% c.config.forum_url %]" target="_blank">forum</a> for help.</p>
