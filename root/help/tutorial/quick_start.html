<h3>Quick Start Guide</h3>

<p>This is the ultra quick start guide for those who want to dive in, but don't want to make stupid mistakes!</p>

<p>There's a full getting started guide <a href="[% base %]help/tutorial/getting_started">here</a>, but if you don't want to read that, here are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Buy some armour for your characters at the equipment shops</li>
	<li>It's best to go down into the town's sewers for your first battles</li>
	<li>If you leave town, don't go attacking every monster group you see! Make sure you check your chances against any groups of monsters you attack 
	    (displayed in the box on the bottom left)</li>
	<li>It's a bad idea to wander around the wilderness aimlessly - that only uses up your turns quickly</li>
	<li>Always log out while in the safety of a town or you risk being attacked, even while you're offline!</li>
	<li>You should change the spells your Priests and Mages have memorised by clicking on their names and going to the spells tab (the spells memorised changes
	    when the next day ticks over)</li>
	<li>Take up some easy quests early on to get more gold and experience</li>
	<li>Don't buy or sell any characters in the beginning</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it! Good luck, and if you run into trouble, check out the <a href="[% base %]help/tutorial/getting_started">full guide</a>,
