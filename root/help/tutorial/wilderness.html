<h3>The Wilderness</h3>

<p>Once you've got the hang of combat in the Sewers, you'll want to head into the Wilderness. Here, you can find monsters of all types, other towns, dungeons and
more. But there are a few things you should know before venturing out of the safety of your starting town.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin: 4px" align="center">
	<img src="[% c.config.static_path %]/images/help/wilderness_sector_tooltip.png" style="border: 1px solid white;"><br>
	<i>Mouse over a sector to see the movement cost</i>
</div>

<p>Firstly, and most importantly, moving around in the Wilderness can use up a lot of turns. In the Sewers, each move cost just [% c.config.cost_of_moving_through_dungeons %] 
turns, and you could move several sectors at a time. In the Wilderness, it can cost up to 7 turns to move into a single sector. Many new parties burn up all their turns by 
moving aimlessly around the Wilderness. Be sure you know why you're moving around. The number of turns you have is displayed
in your party status at the top of the main screen. You can see how much a sector will cost to move into by mousing over it.</p>

<div style="float: left; margin: 4px" align="center">
	<img src="[% c.config.static_path %]/images/help/wilderness_roads.png" style="border: 1px solid white;"><br>
	<i>Moving onto the road means we'll use<br>less turns when travelling</i>
</div>

<p>There are a couple of tricks to making sure you don't use up all your turns by wandering around the Wilderness. Different terrain type has different movement 
costs. Fields are easy to move through, mountains are not! Roads cost less turns to move on, so long as you move along the direction the road is heading.</p>
 
<p>The cost of your movement is controlled by your party's movement factor. This is displayed in your party's status bar. The higher your movement factor, the less 
turns you'll use when moving. Each character has their own movement factor, based on their stats and
how much equipment they're carrying. Don't load up on too much equipment, or you'll find your turns run out before you realise it. (You can always get more turns
by clicking on the "Get More Turns" link in the top right of the main screen to vote for Kingdoms)</p>

<p>The second important thing to know about the Wilderness is that it's not safe to leave your party in the middle of nowhere. They will get attacked by monsters
(yes, even when you're offline!). This is also true if you later find <a href="[% base %]help/reference/dungeons">Dungeons</a> to explore. At higher levels, you may
also be vulnerable to attack by other parties. It's always a good idea to finish up in a town - leave a few turns spare to get there!</p>

<div style="float: right; margin: 4px" align="center">
	<img src="[% c.config.static_path %]/images/help/wilderness_watcher.png" style="border: 1px solid white;"><br>
	<i>The Watcher gives you<br>your chances of winning a battle</i>
</div

<p>Finally, unlike the Sewers, the Wilderness has groups of monsters your party will find challenging and even impossible to beat early on. Luckily, you start with
a "Watcher" effect on your party that lasts 20 game days. This will give you information on what your chances against each monster group are. To see what the Watcher
thinks, move into a sector with a group of monsters, and look in the message window in the bottom left hand corner. You'll see a message giving you "Your chances against
this group". Heed this warning, and only attack monsters the Watcher thinks you will defeat! If your Watcher effect runs out, a Mage in your party can memorise the
Watcher spell and cast it to get the effect for a few more days.</p>

<p>So now you've had the safety briefing, it's time to head out into the wild. In the town menu click "Leave Town", and click on a sector next to the town to leave.
It won't take you long to encounter monsters of all types. You can earn extra experience by taking on Quests, or you can search for high prosperity towns.</p>
