<h3>Your Party</h3>

<div style="float: right; margin: 4px">
	<img src="[% c.config.static_path %]/images/help/char_selection.png" style="border: 1px solid white;"><br>
	<div align="center"><i>Click on a charcter's name to view other characters</i></div>
</div>

<p>We'll start by getting to know your party a little better. On the right hand side of the main screen, you'll see a list of the characters you created for your 
party. If you click on one of their names or portraits you'll open that character's screen. Below the character's name, you'll see a list of the other characters 
in your party, which you can click on to go to their screen.</p>

<div style="float: left; margin: 4px">
	<img src="[% c.config.static_path %]/images/help/char_stats.png" style="border: 1px solid white;"><br>
	<div align="center"><i>Some of a character's stats</i></div>
</div>

<p>Under that, you'll see the character's stats. This includes their race, class, gender, hit points and experience. Three of the most important stats are in the
right handle column: "Attack Factor" (AF), "Defence Factor" (DF) and "Damage". These indicate how good your character is in a fight. The higher the number, the better. So how
do you improve these numbers? There are two main ways:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Buy better equipment</li>
<li>Level up your character, so you get stat points</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>We're not quite ready to do either of thes things yet, but we'll cover them later in this guide. For now, you might want to check out the meagre starting equipment
you get with each character.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin: 4px">
	<img src="[% c.config.static_path %]/images/help/char_equipped_items.png" style="border: 1px solid white;"><br>
	<div align="center"><i>A new character's equipped items</i></div>
</div>

<p>If you click on the 'Equipment' tab (if it's not already showing), you'll see it's split into two panels. On the left, you have Equipped Items, on the right 
the character's inventory. Right now, each character has nothing in their inventory, and only a couple of equipped items (one in each hand). If you mouse over each
item of equipment, you'll see that item's stats. Most of your characters start with a wooden shield - this gives a Defence Factor bonus of 1. This, plus the character's
Agility gives your character their DF total.</p>

<p>If you right click the item, and click 'Unequip Item', you'll see it move to your character's inventory. Notice the character's stats update when you do this (if
you unequipped the wooden shield, you'll see the character's DF reduce). You can click and drag it back to the character's hand to equip the item again. This is very
useful when trying out new pieces of equipment, so you can see what effect it has on the character's stats.</p>

<p>Before we move onto exploring the Town, there's one more thing we need to do. If you have any spell casters in your party (Mages or Priests) we need to check what
spells they have memorised. If you bring up the character screen for a spell caster, you'll see they have an extra 'Spells' tab. Click on that tab, and select the
spells you want that character to memorise. The spells memorised by that character will change the next time the day rolls over (indicated by 'Time To Next Day' in
your status bar at the top of the screen).</p>
