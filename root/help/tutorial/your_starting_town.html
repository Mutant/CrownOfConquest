<h3>Your Starting Town</h3>

<p>Your party starts in a small town, where they can purchase various goods and services. The first thing you'll want to do is visit the local equipment shops. Click
on 'Equipment Shops' in the main town menu (if you've got a character window open, click the close button at the top right to reveal the Town menu). You'll get a 
list of shops in the town. Click on one of the shops that says it is 'open'. Towns can have one or more shops, which open and close as the local economy grows and 
shrinks.</p>

	<i>Purchase as many suits<br>of armour as you can afford</i>
</div>

<p>You'll have noticed in the <a href="[% base %]help/tutorial/your_party">previous section</a> that each member of your party starts with only a weapon and shield. 
If you can find any armour within your price range, it's a good idea to purchase one for each of your characters. (You can do this by
dragging the item in the shop onto the character's name). As the character you're buying it for doesn't already have any armour, it will be auto-equipped as soon as 
you purchase it. You can check this by going back to the character's screen.</p>

<div style="float: left; margin: 4px">

	<div align="center"><i>The town's prosperity is displayed at the top<br>of the town's main menu</i></div>
</div>

<p>If you find your town's local equipment shops are sorely lacking in choice, you can always find another town with a better selection. Each town has a 'prosperity' rating,
which is displayed on the town's main screen (displayed when you first enter a town). The higher the prosperity (up to a maximum of 100), the more likely the town is
to have more shops with better equipment. Of course, leaving town can be dangerous, so you may want to read up on 
<a href="[% base %]help/tutorial/wilderness">The Wilderness</a> first.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin: 4px">
	<img src="[% c.config.static_path %]/images/help/town_quests.png" style="border: 1px solid white;"><br>
	<div align="center"><i>Viewing Offered Quests</i></div>
</div>

<p>Other important points of interest in town are the Healer (which is hopefully self-explanatory) and the Quests hall. The Quests hall offers various quests you can accept
if your party level is high enough (your party's level is indicated in your status bar at the top of the main screen). You can click on one of the quests to get more
information.
Quests are a good way of earning your party gold (and experience). The "Kill x groups of creatures near town" quest is a good one for a new party 
(but be sure to read up on <a href="[% base %]help/tutorial/wilderness">The Wilderness</a> before starting it!)</p>

<p>The rest of the town is yours to explore. Most of the services won't be of much use to a new party, but once you get going, the "Blacksmith" and 
"Recruitment Office" become very important. The Blacksmith lets you upgrade your equipment (for a hefty fee), while at the Recruitment Office, you can find new
characters for your party, or even sell your existing ones. It's best to keep your original party in tact to begin with, and add or remove characters later on, once
you know how to pick characters out (and spot a great deal!).</p>
