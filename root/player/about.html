<h1>About Kingdoms</h1>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>Here's a brief explanation of what the game is - but the best way to find out what it's about is to dive right in... Click <a href="[% base %]/player/register">here</a>
to register.</p>

<p>(Note, as Kingdoms is currently in <a href="#pre-beta">pre-beta</a>, a few of the features below haven't been released yet - but expect to see them over the coming months).</p>

<p>Kingdoms is a "persistent world" role-playing game, where you control a party of characters, exploring a dynamic world, battling creatures, completing
quests, discovering dungeons, and interacting with other parties.</p>

<p>Your party is made up of characters from 4 different classes - Warrior, Archer, Priest and Mage. As with most role-playing games, they're fairly puny to
begin with, but after a few battles, and a few completed quests, they will increase in level, and can afford a some better weapons and armour. After a while,
they'll even be strong enough to find and explore some of the dungeons scattered about the map, and they may even be able to afford to recruit new members
to their ranks.</p>

<p>As your party gains in stature, they'll begin to have a greater impact on the world around them, helping to improve (or hinder!) the prosperity of towns,
form garrisons around the map, construct buildings, become involved in politics and many other actions you don't expect to find in a traditional RPG. For instance,
there are ways for your party to overrun a town, and appoint one of your characters as mayor. The character will have to remain in the town, and can run the town
as they see fit. Of course, if they do a bad job, the peasants may stir up a revolt.</p> 
	
<p>Your actions within the game are limited by turns, which are refreshed each day. If you don't use your turns on a particular day, they'll accumulate for 
a couple of days, meaning you don't have to log in every day.</p>

<a name="pre-beta"></a><h2>Pre-beta</h2>

<p>What's a pre-beta? Isn't that just an alpha? (I hear you ask).</p>

<p>Well, maybe.... when a game goes into "beta", it usually means it's pretty much finished, and all that's left is some final tweaking and bug fixing. In the
case of Kingdoms, the game is far from finished. But because it's web-based, and in the interests of releasing early and often (which hopefully makes for a
better game), Kingdoms has taken more of a "Google" approach to a beta. And since "beta" has a different meaning for games, we decided to call it a "pre-beta".
The idea is to get as much feedback as possible from players, improving as we go.</p>

<p>During the pre-beta, you can usually expect to see about one release a month. Each release usually contains one
major new feature, plus several minor ones (and some bug fixes of course). So you can expect to see the game changing and improving constantly, and have a chance
to contribute feedback, or even make suggestions for features to be included.</p>

<p>So when will it be finished? It's hard to say exactly, and maybe it'll never be completely finished. But as far as the major "core" of the game, we'd estimate
that it's roughly 60% done. So there's a lot more to come!</p>
