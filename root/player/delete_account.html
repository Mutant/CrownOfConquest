<h3>Delete Kingdoms Account</h3>

Clicking on the 'Delete Account' button below will delete your account (and party) permanently. You will no longer be able to log
into Kingdoms, and you will not receive any emails relating to Kingdoms. No record of your account will be kept.

<br><br>

<b>Note</b>: if you'd like to keep playing Kingdoms, but no longer wish to receive the emails, you can change your email options
<a href="[% base %]/party/details?tab=options">here</a>.

<br><br>

Be sure you want to do this, because it <b>cannot</b> be undone!
