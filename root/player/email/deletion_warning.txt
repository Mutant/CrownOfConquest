Hi,

You signed up to Kingdoms ([% url %]), but you haven't logged in in over [% warning_days %] days. If you don't log in within the next 
[% grace_days %] days, your account will be disabled.

You'll be able to re-enable your account by logging back in, although you may lose some standing in the game in the mean time.

Also, there is a maximum number of active players allowed, so if that number has been reached, you won't be able to re-activate your account until 
some other players go inactive (or the maximum number of players is increased).

If you have any questions, or are having technical difficulties, please don't hesitate to reply to this email, or post in our forum: [% forum_url %]
