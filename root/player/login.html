<h1>Welcome to Kingdoms</h1>

<p>Kingdoms is an online "persistent world" role-playing game. It's 100% web-based, meaning there's no download, Flash, Silverlight, etc. And it's free!</p>

<p>In Kingdoms, you control a party of characters, adventuring around a grid-based world, discovering new towns, exploring dungeons, fighting all manner of
foul creatures, and much more. For more on the game, see the <a href="[% base %]/player/about">About</a> page.</p>

<p>Kingdoms is currently in "pre-beta", meaning that - while it's playable - many of the planned features are missing. the <a href="[% base %]/player/about">About</a>
page has more info on the pre-beta.</p>
