<p>We've lately had a lot of problems around our fair Town with groups of monsters harrasing the locals. At great expense, we've consulted our resident
Sages, and they tell us the problem lies with a foul device of the underworld known as the Orb of [% quest.orb_to_destroy.name %].
Our Sages have been able to tell us the Orb lies not far from here, to the [% quest.direction_from_town_to_orb %].</p>

<p>You see, it's this Orb that's been responsible for spawning many of the monsters nearby. The Orb itself is easily destroyed... the trouble is finding it,
not to mention fighting your way through the hoards to get to it. We're told the monsters guarding the sector holding the Orb will fight to the death to
protect it!</p>

<p>If you accept this quest, you must find the Orb, and destroy it, ridding the world of it's evil once and for all! Return to our town hall for a reward of
[% quest.gold_value %] gold. Should some other brave group find and destroy the Orb before you get there, we'll notify you and terminate the quest.</p>
