Recently, a group of thieves raided our town treasury, and stole a beloved artifact, long a part of our town's history. Known only as
"[% quest.item.name %]", it has no material value, but has a deep sentimental significance to our town's people.
<br><br>
Our sages have worked through the night to divine it's location, and now believe it to lie in a dungeon, not far from here (we'll
give you the exact location if you accept the quest).
<br><br>
We need your band of fearless adventures, to enter the dungeon, scour it's rooms, find [% quest.item.name %] and bring it back to
us. Our sages tell us it will probably be found in a treasure chest.
<br><br>
We will reward you richly if you're successful.
