<p>Our craftsmen are skilled in making jewellery and the like. However, lately they've been having trouble finding
[% FILTER inflect %]PL([% jewel %])[% END %].
The local shop owners can't help - they haven't been able to source any themselves. To top things off, the King has requested a new set of jewels for his
Queen.</p>

<p>We'd like you find a [% jewel %], and return it to [% quest.town.town_name %]. Once you've returned, sell it to one of the shop owners, and then come
back to the town hall to collect your reward.</p>
