[% sector_range = quest.sector_range %]

<p>Lately, there have been many raids on the town of [% town.town_name %] by the foul creatures that roam around the wilderness.
The towns people have demanded the authorities do something about this.</p>

<p>We'd like you to hunt down [% quest.param_start_value('Number Of Creatures To Kill') %] groups of creatures near [% town.town_name %], and
wipe out each group completely. The creatures must be killed between the sectors [% sector_range.0.x %], [% sector_range.0.y %]
and [% sector_range.1.x %], [% sector_range.1.y %].</p>

<p>Once you complete the quest, come back here and we will reward you with [% quest.gold_value %] gold.</p>
