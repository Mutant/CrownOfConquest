<p>Relations with the town of [% quest.town_to_raid.town_name %] have deteriorated recently. So much so that the mayor of [% quest.town.town_name %]
feels they need to be taught a lesson. Their treasury is bulging with ill-gotten gains. It's about time we took some of it back!</p>

<p>Go to [% quest.town_to_raid.town_name %], and - by whatever means necessary - reclaim some gold from their treasury. If your raid is successful, you may keep
whatever booty you claim, and on top of that we'll pay you [% quest.gold_value %] gold.</p>
