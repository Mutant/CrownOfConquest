<h3>Traps</h3>

You can purchase traps for the town. These will trigger against raiders, with more severe effects, depending on the level. Traps incur a mainteance fee each day.
If the town is unable to pay the cost, the traps will automatically be downgraded a level.

<br><br>

[% IF town.trap_level <= 0 %]
Your town has no traps.
[% ELSE %]
Your town has level [% town.trap_level %] traps. The maintenance cost is [% trap_maint_cost %] gold per day.<br>
[% END %]

[% IF town.trap_level < trap_max_level %]
	Cost to upgrade to the next level is [% trap_upgrade_cost %] gold.
[% ELSE %]
	The town's traps are at the maximum level.
[% END %]

(Downgrading is free).
